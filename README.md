# Watcher of Friends Online

The script checks the status of your friends on the VK.com and displays a list of friends who are online.

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# How to use

After running the program script, you will be asked to enter your login on the VK.com and password, after execution the script will give a list of friends online.
```bash
`$python vk_friends_online.py
Type login VK: _MyAccountLogin_
Type your password: _MyPasswordLogin_
Friends online:
_MyOnlineFriendsList_
```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
